## Analyst:

Analyst users have limited access to the control panel. They are allowed to read most data in the dashboard, except for sensitive information like API keys and SMTP passwords. We’ve designed this role for marketers, product managers, and other users who would like access to reporting features.

## Billing: 

Billing users can change payment settings, review invoices, and inquire about billing issues, but they will not be able to make account-level changes. Many organizations have billing administrators who are responsible for managing spend and paying invoices, and this role is for them.

## Support: 

In addition to read privileges, support users have the ability to edit suppressions, manage mailing list members, and open/comment on support tickets. This role is designed for users in your organization who may need to troubleshoot deliverability issues for recipients.

## Developer: 

Developer users have access to read API keys and SMTP credentials so they can configure applications that are leveraging Mailgun. It’s a highly trusted role that has the ability to manipulate most settings on the account, except for editing account details and managing control panel users, API keys, and SMTP credentials.

## Admin: 

Admin users have full access to the account. They can add and remove dashboard users, manage credentials, and do everything a Developer user can do. In other words, they can do everything.
